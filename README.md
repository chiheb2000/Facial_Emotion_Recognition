This project implements an emotion recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system takes facial images as input and detects emotions such as 😡 *Angry*, 😄 *Happy*, 😢 *Sad*, 😲 *Surprise*, and more. It uses OpenCV to detect faces and then predicts the emotion using a trained deep learning model.


## 🌟 Features
- **Face Detection** 🕵️‍♂️: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in an image or video.
- **Emotion Prediction** 🤖: A pre-trained deep learning model is used to classify emotions from the detected face.
- **Real-Time Prediction** 📹: Works with both static images and real-time video streams from a webcam.

## 📚 Dataset
The model is trained on the [FER 2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which contains grayscale images of faces labeled with one of seven emotions:

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 **Python 3.8 or later**
- 🖼️ **OpenCV** (for image and video processing)
- 🤖 **TensorFlow / Keras** (for deep learning model development)
- 🔢 **NumPy** (for numerical computations)

## 🖥️ Displaying Results

Once the system processes an image or video stream, it shows the detected faces with labels indicating the predicted emotions.

- **For images**: 🖼️ A box appears around each face with the predicted emotion displayed above.

- **For real-time video (using the webcam)**: 📹 The system predicts emotions in real-time, updating the label as the person's expression changes.
